Mod created by MarinInBlackMesa. He had since taken down the codes after many people claiming it supports Nazism, and it very much does.

He had since privated/deleted the codes for the mod. Thankfully, someone had the codes for Yockey/Byers and had sent it to me.

I fixed some images and stuff.

NOTE: I AM NOT A NEO-NAZI, NOR ASSOCIATED WITH IT. WHAT MARIN DID IS SHAMEFUL TO ANY GOOD BEING. THIS REPOSITORY IS FOR ARCHIVAL PURPOSES ONLY!!!
